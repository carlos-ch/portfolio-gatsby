  Portfolio Gatsby
</h1>

A personal portfolio use as my personal website.

## Description

The idea behind this portfolio was to have a home page for people interested in my work. This portfolio provides:

- professional/personal information about me
- showcase of past and current (maybe also future) projects
- contact information

### Tech Stack

Since the idea was to future-proof this project and make it as easily managable and scalable as possible, JAM stack was a clear choice. Combining a static website generator (SSG) and content management system (CMS).

- Gatsby (SSG)
- Strapi (CMS)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Cloudinary (image databse)

### Roadmap

This is the first iteration for this project and any feedback or comment for improvment is warmly welcome.

The next step for this project is to connect it to a blogging platforms or even explore more features of Gatsby and create a blog post template.
